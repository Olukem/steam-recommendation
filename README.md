This project involved creating a collaborative filtering recommendation system for Steam games using Apache Spark and MLlib by uploading project files, including the dataset steam-200k.csv, which contains user interactions such as purchases and playtime. The data was preprocessed, analyzed, and used to train a model leveraging the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm to predict and recommend games based on user behavior. Visualizations and evaluations were conducted using Python libraries like matplotlib. The project was then deployed to GitHub Pages to showcase the results, demonstrating the application of big data and machine learning techniques in building practical recommendation systems.
